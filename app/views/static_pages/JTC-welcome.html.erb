<h2 class='text-center'>Junior Trainee Club Part 1: Welcome to the team!</h2>
<br>
<p>We are so happy you have decided to join us! Our Bioluminescence Hub, a National Science Foundation NeuroNex Technology Hub, is inspired by the light that some organisms are able to create and use to survive in the natural world. We build tools with this living light to study the brain. As you work through these modules, you will learn about what bioluminescence is and how it is used in nature and in scientific labs to study the brain.</p>

<p>Check out this fantastic resource from the California Academy of Sciences for tips to create your very own <a class='bl-link' href='https://www.calacademy.org/educators/setting-up-your-science-notebooks' target='_blank'>science notebook</a>. Science notebooks are a place for careful observations, accurate record keeping, and creativity. After setting up your notebook, use it to record your thoughts, observations, questions, and responses throughout trainee activities.</p>
<br>
<p>In your notebook, work through this <a class='bl-link' href='https://www.calacademy.org/educators/lesson-plans/draw-a-scientist' target='_blank'>Draw a Scientist Activity</a> with a parent, teacher, or friend. Compare your drawings, how are they similar and how are they different? There is no one way that a scientist looks, science is for everyone. You are a scientist and a member of our team!</p>

<p>"As a brain scientist, I use bright bioluminescent tools that light up the brain to see what's happening inside. I start by picking a part of the brain that we don't know much about, for example, a small section near the back. I attach a special bioluminescent molecule to a part of a mouse's brain, and watch it glow. The brighter it glows, the more that brain area is helping the mouse think at that moment. For example, I might put the bioluminescent molecule in the back of the brain, near the top. Letâ€™s say I then have the mouse watch TV. If the back of the brain is really dim and dark, it means the mouse is not using that part of the brain at the moment. If all of a sudden a zebra pops up on the TV, and the back-top of the brain gets REALLY BRIGHT, then we know the back-top part of the mouse brain helps the mouse think about zebras."</p>

    <p>We hosted 13 undergraduates from 10 colleges in seven states for a week of lectures and hands-on learning at the MBL in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. A schedule of our activities can be found <a class='bl-link' href='/mbl/schedule'>here</a>. The week culminated in technology venture presentations where teams of students pitched an idea for a new technology using bioluminescence in an effort to earn votes from their classmates and faculty. There was great energy and enthusiasm from all participants for the duration of the practicum, but don’t just take our word for it – read our <a class='bl-link' href='/mbl/testimonials'>student testimonials</a>. We are already looking forward to next year!</p>

    <p>We enjoyed a guided tour of the MBL’s Rare Books room where students handled T. H. Morgan’s Nobel Prize, a fourth edition <span class='italics'>Origin of Species</a> inscribed by Darwin himself, and paged through volumes with hundreds of hand-painted accounts of marine animals.</p>

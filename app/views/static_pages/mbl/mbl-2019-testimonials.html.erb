    <h2 class='text-center'>Testimonials from the 2019 Practicum</h2>
    <div class='testimonial'>
        <p class='mbl'>"I really enjoyed the collaborative nature of the practicum. The instructors were extremely accessible and willing to talk with students throughout the week. I also loved getting to know fellow students and having time at the end of the day to work together on our projects."</p>

        <p class='mbl'>"Some of my most memorable experiences during the Practicum definitely involved the activities we did (the Nobska Light hike, the aquarium, the rare books collection, the marine resources center), all the meals that we shared as a group, all of [the] lectures, the fluorescent protein lab, the lipofection lab, the lamprey lab, and the technology venture presentation. This whole week was a smashing success, and I immensely enjoyed my time here. It truly was one of the most transformative experiences I have ever had in my life, and I loved how everyone brought something different to the world of bioluminescence, but also to the group as a whole."</p>

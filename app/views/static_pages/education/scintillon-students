    <h2 class='text-center'>Summer 2018 at the Scintillon Institute</h2>

    <p>The Shaner laboratory was fortunate to host three excellent summer students this summer! Tariq, Hira, and Ryann each kindly shared their experience and personal perspectives below. We wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors, and will make sure they stay in touch!</p>
    <p>Summer research opportunities for undergraduates are occasionally available at each of the Hub’s locations: Brown University, Central Michigan University, and the Scintillon Institute. For more information, please <a class='bl-link' href="mailto: neuronex1@gmail.com"> contact us</a>!</p>

            <h3>Tariq Brown</h3>
            <p>My time at Scintillon was a rewarding ten-week experience where I was able to dive into the development of fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins. I was initially drawn to the research at Scintillon after engaging in a week-long NeuroNex Practicum where I learned more about the origins and applications of these light-emitting proteins. Discovering the history behind these proteins, and the possibilities of their applications, made me eager to become involved in their optimization and utility.</p>

            <p>I was able to learn how to design experiments using fundamental molecular biological methods including polymerase-chain reaction, cloning, protein extraction, and computer-facilitated scans for fluorescence/bioluminescence. <img class='float-right pll mtl mbl' style='width: 30%;' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/bl-hub/scintillon-students/Tariq_2-min.jpg' />The summation of these techniques allowed me to perform multiple rounds of directed evolution on various fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins. I had the pleasure of working with one of the brightest green fluorescent proteins and two of its variants. One of the most gratifying moments is being able to visibly see the variation in colors and brightness in a mutant library on an agar plate. It is a nice change of pace compared to waiting for results to be displayed as numbers on a computer screen.</p>

            <p>As I transition into my neuroscience graduate program, I hope to carry the fundamental biology methods and skills into my research. I hope to be able to use some of the proteins I helped develop during this summer in my research. Hopefully, I stay affiliated with BL-OG so I can continue developing one of the most unique methods to elucidate the brain’s mysteries.</p>

            <h3>Hira Choudhry</h3>
            <p>I am a senior at Hunter College and aspire to be a physician one day. Compared to my colleagues, I did not have a strong research background. I volunteered in a lab before but never held my own project. So I truly did not know what a real research experience felt like. I was really eager to learn and excited to embark on this new adventure.
            <p>Dr. Nathan Shaner expressed the opportunity to apply for an Intern position at his lab in the MBL practicum. I was so pleased with all that I learned about fluorescent proteins and bioluminescence at MBL that I got really excited and wanted to learn more. Plus, who does not want to spend their summer in the land of palm trees? When I came to California, I was intimidated by the work. However, Gerry and Dr. Shaner were ready to teach all of us from the start. From learning how to pipette properly on the first week to presenting my own research on the last week, it was an enlightening experience.</p>
            <p>I was working with a monomeric red fluorescent protein from a coral <span class='italics'>Acropora millepora</span> (mAmil). <img class='float-right pll mtl mbl' style='width:35%;' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/bl-hub/scintillon-students/Hira_1-min.jpeg' />My research project was on trying to optimize the spectra qualities of mAmil. This involved knowing the most basic lab techniques from PCR to cloning and performing chemical/electrical transformation and finally miniprepping the DNA. Most importantly, I performed data analysis using the Tecan. We also created our own primers, a very advanced lab technique!!! This is a gradual learning process and towards the last month, I was so comfortable with the techniques. This project has taught me patience and resilience and that little progress is still progress! I had the opportunity to work alongside not only college students but also high school students. We all learned from each other. The lab felt more like family.</p>
            <p>This experience has made me confident in my lab technique skills. From being intimidated to confident in all that I have learned has made me a stronger student. This was not an ordinary lab; our amazing lab faculty would take us on spontaneous adventures. We went to the zoo and the beach! We also went to a Mexican restaurant to grab burritos while our DNA was incubating! As heavy as the research was and the endless hours we spent in lab, I am grateful for all the knowledge I acquired, the support I received throughout my project, and for the lifelong friends I have made.</p>

            <h3>Ryann Felton</h3>
            <p>This summer I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Nathan Shaner at the Scintillon Institute in San Diego, California. I first heard of this opportunity from Dr. Shaner himself at the NeuroNex Practicum held in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. At the end of the program, Dr. Shaner announced he was looking for undergraduate students to work in his lab for the upcoming summer. I knew that Dr. Shaner would be an ideal researcher/teacher that would provide me with an excellent learning opportunity. During the NeuroNex Practicum, I would approach Dr. Shaner for help and he would answer my countless questions as well as encourage me and my ideas. I had a great time learning about bioluminescence and its applications from him. As a result, I did not want my exposure to the world of bioluminescence to be confined only to my time at Woods Hole. Unfortunately, none of the professors at my college conduct research pertaining to bioluminescence; however, Dr. Shaner allowed me to satisfy my desire to continue my learning experience at his laboratory in San Diego.</p>
            <p>Over the course of ten weeks at the Scintillon Institute, I learned how to conduct mutagenesis, transfect bacteria and mammalian cells, <img style='width:35%;' class='float-right pll mbl mtl' src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/bl-hub/scintillon-students/Ryann_2-min.jpeg' />read genome sequences, design oligos, collect and interpret data from a spectral distribution, photobleach proteins, use a confocal microscope, and so much more. Most of the skills that I learned was within the first week. Dr. Shaner and his labmates were so thorough with conducting procedures and explaining the reasoning behind each step and chemicals used that when it came to doing things on my own, I was extremely confident. Additionally, I learned lab maintenance skills such as making stock solutions, gels, and agar plates.</p>
            <p>I plan to use the molecular biology skills that I learn from Dr. Shaner in the lab at my college. This upcoming year I will graduate from Hope College with Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience. I plan to then take a gap year and hopefully continue to do research or work as a Certified Nurse Assistant before going to medical school. My long-term goal is to become a neurologist or a psychiatrist and possibly obtain a doctorate in neuroscience.</p>
            <p>I cannot not fully express what a wonderful experience and opportunity that was provided to me this summer. It was actually life changing. The research as well as the relationships developed was exceptionally inspiring. My love for research was definitely expanded.</p>

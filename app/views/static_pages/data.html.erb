    <p>Our NeuroNex Technology Hub is committed to Open Science, the sharing of knowledge and tools to drive scientific discovery and innovation. Our efforts can be viewed in two dimensions, as shown above.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>We will develop best practices in <strong class='text-green'><span class='italics'>horizontal</span> Open Science</strong> by promoting the utility and awareness of bioluminescence as a tool for research via our Workshops, Emissaries, Symposia, and access to our molecular constructs and data sets. With these events and information, we will promote free and transparent exchange to foment collaboration among scientists and scientific disciplines.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>We will develop best practices in <strong class='text-purple'><span class='italics'>vertical</span> Open Science</strong> by using the multidisciplinary principles of bioluminescent reactions to stoke public interest in science and to educate students of all levels. Through annual public outreach events, our Practicum for Undergraduates at the Marine Biological Laboratory, and via freely available, online curricula, we will share our knowledge broadly.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Together, this approach drives knowledge and tool development and the creation of new technologies and industries.</p>
